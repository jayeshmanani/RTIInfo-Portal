            </header>
            <p><strong>RTI stands for Right to Information.</strong> Right to Information Act 2005 mandates timely response to citizen requests for government information. Right to Information empowers every citizen to seek any information from the Government, inspect any Government documents and seek certified photocopies thereof. Right to Information also empowers citizens to official inspect any Government work or to take the sample of material used in any work.</p>
            <p>Right to Information is a part of fundamental rights under Article 19(1) of the Constitution. Article 19 (1) says that every citizen has freedom of speech and expression.</p>
            <p>Even though RTI is a fundamental right, still we need RTI Act to give us this right. This is because if you went to any Government Department and told the officer there, “RTI is my fundamental right and that I am the master of this country.</p>
            
            <header>
              <center><h2><strong>Objective of RTI Act?</strong></h2></center>
            </header>
            <p>The basic object of the Right to Information Act is to empower the citizens, promote transparency and accountability in the working of the Government, contain corruption, and make our democracy work for the people in real sense. An informed citizenry will be better equipped to keep necessary vigil on the instruments of government and make the government more accountable to the governed.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen may request information from a “public authority” (a body of Government or “instrumentality of State”) which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days. The Act also requires every public authority to computerise their records for wide dissemination and to proactively disclose certain categories of information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for information formally. This law was passed by Parliament on 15 June 2005 and came fully into force on 12 October 2005.</p>
            <p>“record” includes: a) Any document, manuscript and file b) Any microfilm, microfiche, and facsimile copy of a document c) Any reproduction of image or images embodied in such microfilm (whether enlarged or not); and d) Any other material produced by a computer or any other device;</p>
